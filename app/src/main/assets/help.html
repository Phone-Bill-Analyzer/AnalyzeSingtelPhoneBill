<h1>Getting Started</h1>
Thank you for downloading this app.
<br><br>
Now, you have the option to really understand your phone bill and analyze the usage also.
Just upload your mobile phone bill and start your analysis.

<h3>Upload Mobile Bill:</h3>
On the main screen, select option: New Bill and upload new bill. <br>
Currently we are supporting only SingTel Post Paid mobile bills in PDF formats.<br>
The PDF file should <b>NOT</b> be encrypted.<br>
You must download the bill in PDF format from SingTel. Scanned copy of a printed bill will <b>NOT</b> work. <br><br>
<b>Note :</b>
<ul>
    <li>If you are unable to browse files, please install a good file browser app.</li>
    <li>In the file browser screen, activate 'Display advanced devices' option to see all files and folders</li>
</ul>


<h3>Analysis</h3>
After you have successfully uploaded your bill, you can see your bill details on the main screen. Select your bill to start analyzing. 
As of now, you can see the following analysis:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Itemised bill</li>
    <li>Top 5 callers by Name</li>
    <li>Call costs by Contact groups</li>
</ul>

In future, we are planning to show more analytics.

Important Points to note:
<ul>
<li>You can assign a contact to multiple groups. </li>
<li>You can update contact names, groups and group members after uploading the bill also. Hence, the bill analysis will continue to show old names and old groups.</li>
